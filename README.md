# Gather your party with Svelte

Lorem ipsum introduction text

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies with `npm ci`.

1. To start the development server and open the application: `npm run dev -- --open`

## Workshop

All tasks are listed in file `workshop-tasks.md` located in the root of the project.

Both this file and the `workshop-tasks` file can be viewed on the [homepage](http://localhost:3000).

## Tips

- If you're unfamiliar with TypeScript and do not wish to use it in your Svelte component files, you can remove
  the `lang="ts"` attribute at the top of the `<script>` tag.
- While it's not necessary, if you like using a code style formatter, `prettier` is set up in this project.
  You can run it in two different ways:
  - If you have it set up in your Editor you can run it via the editor on the file you're working on.
  - Run `npm run format` in the terminal to format all your sourcefiles.
