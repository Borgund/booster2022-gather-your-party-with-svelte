The \`PortraitPreview\` component takes three different props and dispatches one event:
- Prop \`value\`: The value of a portrait that it should show.
- Prop \`clickable\`: Boolean prop that makes the preview style itself to indicate it can be clicked.
- Prop \`isLoading\`: Shows a loading indicator inside the portrait frame to indicate that the portrait is currently loading.
- Event \`click\`: Fires when a clickable portrait is clicked. It provides the value of the portrait in its \`details\` object. You can listen to this event by using the \`on:click\` syntax.\
